# Elementals (card game)

_Elementals_ is a variant of the card game [Clear the Dungeon](https://www.riffleshuffleandroll.com/clear-the-dungeon) (v1.2.0), which was originally designed by Mark S. Ball. This version is inspired by the _Warcraft_ franchise. It requires a standard 52-card deck of French-suited playing cards and 2 jokers. A game typically lasts about 5 minutes.

## Setting

The game is set on primordial Azeroth. To protect the nascent world-soul, the Pantheon sends its titan-forged armies to wage war on the Elemental Lords, who have been enslaved by the Old Gods and are wreaking havoc across the world. Using the elements against them, the titans seek to imprison the elementals in another dimension...

## Cards

### Suits and ranks

Each suit represents an element and its associated magic:

- Hearts = water
- Diamonds = earth
- Spades = fire
- Clubs = air

Numbered cards, aces and jokers represent the magic-wielding _titan-forged_. They constitute the player's _titan deck_. Their suit indicates the type of elemental damage dealt. Jokers deal arcane damage, which bypasses any elemental immunity.

Face cards represent the _elementals_ to be defeated. Kings are the _Elemental Lords_, namely:

- K♥ = Neptulon
- K♦ = Therazane
- K♠ = Ragnaros
- K♣ = Al'Akir

Queens and jacks are their lieutenants.

### Power level

For the titan-forged, a card's _power level_ is the amount of damage it deals. For the elementals, it indicates the amount of damage necessary to defeat them. The values are as following:

- Numbered cards = the number on the card
- Aces = 1
- Jokers = any number from 1 to 10
- Jacks = 11
- Queens = 12
- Kings = 13

## Setup

The player shuffles the titan deck and places it to their right.

The elementals are placed face down in one of the three following layouts:

       []        []       []
      [][]      [][]     [][]
     [][][]    [][][]     []
    [][][][]    [][]     [][]
     []  []      []       []
                [][]     [][]
                 []     [][][]

Each row of cards should partially overlap the row above it. Cards in the bottom row are revealed before the beginning of the game.

## Playing

The player starts the turn by drawing three _attack cards_ from the titan deck. These make up the player's hand.

Cards are played by placing them on revealed elementals that the player wishes to target. To defeat an elemental, three attack cards must be played in order:

- **Two damage cards**. Their combined power level must be greater or equal to that of the target. Elementals are immune to magic based on their own element. For example, a titan-forged wielding fire magic cannot damage a fire elemental.
- **One banish card**. Its power level does not matter, but its element must match that of the target.

This sequence can be also achieved over multiple turns (the three cards do not have to be the ones the player just drew).

Upon defeat, the elemental is banished to the _Elemental Plane_, i.e., it is placed face down on the discard pile to the player's left, along with the attack cards. Exception: if the card is an Elemental Lord, it is not discarded right away but becomes an _elemental power_. The player can save this card for later use by placing it in a row under the titan deck (see § [Elemental powers](#powers)).

When an elemental card in the next row is completely uncovered, it may be revealed. This must be done immediately, as it may enable the player to play more cards.

If the player cannot play a card (or does not want to), it must be discarded and placed in a row to the right of the titan deck. Its power level counts as hit damage against the player.

The turn ends when all three cards have either been played or discarded. The player then draws three more cards and continues their assault.

### Elemental powers

When defeating an Elemental Lord, the player absorbs their power, which can be unleashed at any time:

- **Whispers of Neptulon** (K♥). The player selects a card from their hand and places it at the bottom of the titan deck.
- **Therazane's Touch** (K♦). The player can look at the bottom card of the titan deck and move it to the top if they wish.
- **Hand of Ragnaros** (K♠). The power level of the selected attack card is doubled.
- **Breath of Al'Akir** (K♣). The player draws a random card from the titan deck.

Once used, the power card is sent to the Elemental Plane.

## End of the game

The player wins the game if they defeat all elementals before taking 33 or more points of damage.
