# Elementals (card game)

_Elementals_ is a variant of the card game [Clear the Dungeon](https://www.riffleshuffleandroll.com/clear-the-dungeon) (v1.2.0), which was originally designed by Mark S. Ball. This version is inspired by the _Warcraft_ franchise. It requires a standard 52-card deck of French-suited playing cards and 2 jokers. A game typically lasts about 5 minutes.

## Setting

The game is set on primordial Azeroth. To protect the nascent world-soul, the Pantheon sends its titan-forged armies to wage war on the Elemental Lords, who have been enslaved by the Old Gods and are wreaking havoc across the world. Using the elements against them, the titans seek to imprison the elementals in another dimension...

## Rules

The game rules are found in the `elementals_game_rules.md` file.
