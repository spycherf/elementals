# Elementals (card game)

_Elementals_ is a variant of the single-player card game [Clear the Dungeon](https://www.riffleshuffleandroll.com/clear-the-dungeon) (v1.2.0), which was originally designed by Mark S. Ball. This version, inspired by the _Warcraft_ franchise, introduces new layouts, damage types and an immunity mechanic. The hit damage system has also been revised to be less punitive and have more impact on gameplay. A standard 52-card deck of French-suited playing cards and 2 jokers are required to play. A game typically lasts about 5 minutes.

## Setting

The game is set on primordial Azeroth. To protect the nascent world-soul, the Pantheon sends its titan-forged armies to wage war on the Elemental Lords, who have been enslaved by the Old Gods and are wreaking havoc across the world. Using the elements against them, the titans seek to imprison the elementals in another dimension...

## Rules

The game rules are found in the [`elementals_game_rules.md`](https://github.com/spycherf/elementals/blob/main/elementals_game_rules.md) file.
